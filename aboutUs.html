<h1 class="background" > HOW IT ALL BEGAN </h1>

  <div class="kitchen">
<p class="awesome"> Pizza Inc. is an Italian restaurant founded in September 18 of 2018 by Aneesh Antel, Cong Thang Trinh, and Ziyang She, as a single location in Washington, DC. The idea behind Pizza inc. came from our founders who met while working together at the Italian restaurant in Washington, DC, Sfoglia. Three founders quickly became friends working as chiefs at Sfoglia, but they were never satisfied with recipes of the main chef who firmly believed in the traditional recipes should be kept original. Together three friends decided to quit and began to work on opening pizza parlor from the small studio apartment that they rented for $600.</p>

    <p class="awesome"> However, after sometime three friends discovered that opening pizza parlor proved to be a harder challenge. Our founders struggled with idea to create an affordable yet hulking pizza experience to distinct themselves from other pizza shops. Months go by, and our three founders began their business in mobile pizza food truck service called “PizzaManiacs”. Food truck business proved to only be enough to sustain the business, but it was nowhere close in their original vision to revolutionize pizza industry. Though the barely floating food truck business, our founders had learned valuable experience though errors and trials. They have continuously experimented in pizza recipe with different ingredients and methods.</p>

    <p class="awesome"> Trials and errors were part of the Pizza Inc. Journey after which our founders were able to create amazing pizza recipes that incorporate not only Italian techniques, but also indian, south-east asian, and even french techniques that we, Pizza Inc. proudly serve today. Countless failures created what we know todas as Pizza Inc. that not only will wow your tastebuds, but also is affordable. However, our co-founders didn’t stop there, even today we keep experimenting and creating thousands recipes, but leaving only few of which will certainly make you come back to us. Our promise to you is Pizza Inc. will never stop amaze you and the whole pizza industry with our unique recipes.</p>

        <p>One of your co-founder, Cong Trinh, has long been passionate in culinary since he was young. His passion led him into researching and experimenting in mixing different and sometimes polar opposite cuisines into new and exciting to
          tastebuds dishes while emphasizing on healthy side of his dishes.
          Throughout the many years of trials, experiments, failures, and successes, one of Cong’s idea is to substitute traditional wheat flour with rice based flour which is not only delicious, but also gluten-free which would allow so many people
          to enjoy the wonders of pizza. A clean, delicious, and also gluten free pizza crust recipe can be extremely hard to find these days. Most recipes contain added gums, such as guar or xanthan gum</p>

        <p>One of your co-founders, Victor, he wants to combine eastern and western food cultures. So he tried to mix two seemingly unrelated food elements from two different countries and make a new pizza, like rice pizza. Rice is a common staple food in Eastern China, pizza is also a common staple food in the West. In keeping with the traditional pizza making style, get rid of the traditional chicken, beef and other food elements, and add new elements of the East that have not been tested, such as replacing the traditional western chicken and beef with Chinese rice and roast duck as the main material. Figs or fermented bean curd replace the traditional western cheese and tomato sause as a seasoning. Through the combination of multiple elements, create more creative new dishes, stimulate our taste buds, so that customers will always have a fresh experience.</p>
