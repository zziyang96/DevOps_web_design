          <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 2018</h5>
          <p class="w3-large">One of your co-founder, Cong Trinh, has long been passionate in culinary since he was
            young. His passion led him into researching and experimenting in mixing different and
            sometimes polar opposite cuisines into new and exciting to tastebuds dishes while emphasizing
            on healthy side of his dishes. </p>
            <button onclick="myFunction()">Show/Hide</button>
            <div id="hide">
          <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">Cong is from country of Vietnam in South East Asia where cooks primary focused on
creating healthy and well-balanced meals. For example, pho – worldwide famous noodle soups
which have a great balance between meat, vegetable, broth, and rice flour noodle. During his
teen years, he had a chance to travel to origin country of pizza, Italy. He was mesmerized by
Italian pizza masters and by the diversity of ingredients included in cooking that has pushed
original pizza, Neapolitan pizza, to evolve into many different styles of pizza like world famous
deep dish pizza or Chicago pizza and New York style pizza. Coming back home, Cong has started
his long path with his two co-founders in creating what we call Pizza Inc. His dream became to
not only be an Italian pizza master, but also to surpass them by creating a new type of pizza at
would be of taste to anyone of any age.</p>
              <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium"> Throughout the many years of trials, experiments, failures, and successes, one of Cong’s
idea is to substitute traditional wheat flour with rice based flour which is not only delicious, but
also gluten-free which would allow so many people to enjoy the wonders of pizza. A clean,
delicious, and also gluten free pizza crust recipe can be extremely hard to find these days. Most
recipes contain added gums, such as guar or xanthan gum which can be hard on the digestive
system, particularly for those with low stomach acid. Additionally, most paleo pizza crusts are
made with tapioca starch, almond flour, arrowroot, or potato starch which can also be
problematic digestively.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">One of your co-founders, Victor she, lives in China. One day, a friend of Victor opened a pizza shop and invited him to visit. Ever since he took a mouthful of chicken and vegetable pizza, he has fallen in love with pizza. But he thinks pizza's flavor is limited to western elements too monotonous. So he wondered if we could combine the two different elements of food culture from the East and the West and create some new pizzas.</p>

          <div id="hide2">
          <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">Based on this idea, Victor, he wondered if we could mix two seemingly unrelated food elements from two different countries and make a new pizza, like rice pizza. Rice is a common staple food in Eastern China, pizza is also a common staple food in the West. In keeping with the traditional pizza making style, get rid of the traditional chicken, beef and other food elements, and add new elements of the East that have not been tested, such as replacing the traditional western chicken and beef with Chinese rice and roast duck as the main material. Figs or fermented bean curd replace the traditional western cheese and tomato sause as a seasoning. Through the combination of multiple elements, create more creative new dishes, stimulate our taste buds, so that customers will always have a fresh experience.</p>
